![Screenshot of end product](docs/screenshot.png)

This repo is created to use the data processed in the [functional-programming repo](https://github.com/theonejonahgold/functional-programming), to create a data visualisation using D3. The data consists of parking data gathered by the RDW (Dutch Vehicle Authority), which can bring many great insights when put into a data visualisation. Read more about the assingment in my [Debriefing](https://github.com/theonejonahgold/functional-programming/wiki/Debriefing-üêí), and read about the concept [further below](#concept)

## Learning goals

- Understanding how D3 works
- Using D3 to create a data visualisation with data I myself have processed.

## Getting started

### Setting up the repo

To get started, you first need to clone the repo and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/theonejonahgold/frontend-data
cd frontend-data
yarn install || yarn
```

### Available commands

```bash
yarn dev   # Opens a dev server and watches src files.
yarn build # Builds a bundle for the website.
yarn lint  # Runs ESLint on files to check for consistent code.
```

## Concept

[Extended version](https://github.com/theonejonahgold/frontend-data/wiki/Concept-ü¶ß)

### Main Question

What is the relation between distance and availability of parking places to hot-spots in the city?

### Research questions

- How close are parking areas to the hot-spot?
- What are the average hours of the parking areas?
- What are the capacities of the parking areas?

### Used variables

The used variables are available through [this link](https://github.com/theonejonahgold/frontend-data/wiki/Concept-ü¶ß#gebruikte-variabelen).
